# Architecture Overview

This document describes the architecture of the LLM-based memory safety analysis tool.

## System Overview

The tool performs compositional, bottom-up analysis of C/C++ code to generate Hoare-style safety contracts (requires/ensures) per function. It processes functions in dependency order (callees before callers) so that callee contracts are available when analyzing callers.

The summarization pipeline is the **code-contract** pass, which produces per-function, per-property (memsafe/memleak/overflow) contracts in a single unified pass with interleaved verification. (A legacy multi-pass pipeline of allocation/free/init/memsafe/verify summarizers still ships as Python classes for batch-script use, but is no longer wired into the CLI.)

Analysis is **link-unit aware**: each build target (library, executable) gets its own database, and targets are processed in dependency order so that library contracts are available when analyzing executables that link them.

```

## Components

### 1. Function Extractor (`extractor.py`)

Uses libclang to parse C/C++ source files and extract function definitions.

**Key classes:**
- `FunctionExtractor`: Basic extraction with function signatures and source
- `FunctionExtractorWithBodies`: Full parsing including function bodies for call analysis

**Output:** List of `Function` objects containing:
- Function name and signature
- File path and line numbers
- Complete source code
- Source hash for change detection

### 2. Call Graph Builder (`callgraph.py`)

Builds the call graph by analyzing function bodies for call expressions.

**Features:**
- Extracts direct function calls
- Records callsite locations (file, line, column)
- Integrates with indirect call analysis

**Key class:** `CallGraphBuilder`

### 3. Indirect Call Analysis (`indirect/`)

Handles function pointer calls and virtual methods.

#### Scanner (`indirect/scanner.py`)
Finds functions whose addresses are taken:
- `&function` expressions
- Function passed as callback argument
- Function assigned to pointer variable

#### Callsite Finder (`indirect/callsites.py`)
Identifies indirect call expressions:
- `ptr->callback(args)`
- `handlers[i](args)`
- `(*fptr)(args)`

#### Resolver (`indirect/resolver.py`)
Uses LLM to determine likely targets for indirect calls based on:
- Matching function signatures
- Code context
- Address flow information

#### Flow Summarizer (`indirect/flow_summarizer.py`)
Uses LLM to analyze where function addresses flow to (struct fields, globals, callback registrations).

### 4. Topological Ordering (`ordering.py`)

Computes processing order using Tarjan's SCC algorithm.

**Features:**
- Identifies strongly connected components (recursive function groups)
- Orders SCCs topologically (callees before callers)
- Handles mutual recursion

**Key class:** `ProcessingOrderer`

### 5. LLM Backends (`llm/`)

Abstraction layer for different LLM providers.

**Base class:** `LLMBackend`
- `complete(prompt, system)`: Generate completion
- `complete_with_metadata(prompt, system)`: Get completion with token counts

**Implementations:**
- `ClaudeBackend`: Anthropic Claude API
- `OpenAIBackend`: OpenAI API (also works with compatible APIs)
- `OllamaBackend`: Local models via Ollama
- `LlamaCppBackend`: Local models via llama.cpp server
- `GeminiBackend`: Google Gemini API via Vertex AI

**Thread pool:** `LLMPool` (`llm/pool.py`) — `ThreadPoolExecutor` wrapper for parallel LLM queries, used by `BottomUpDriver` when `-j` > 1.

### 6. Graph Traversal Driver (`driver.py`)

Unified bottom-up traversal engine. Builds the call graph once, computes SCCs, and runs one or more summary passes over functions in topological order (callees first). Sourceless stubs (stdlib functions without bodies) are skipped from all passes.

**Key classes:**
- `BottomUpDriver`: Owns graph building (cached) and SCC traversal. `run(passes, force, dirty_ids, pool)` executes all passes per function.
- `SummaryPass` (Protocol): Interface each pass implements — `get_cached()`, `summarize()`, `store()`
- `CodeContractPass`: The primary pass — Hoare-style per-property contracts (see §7a)
- `AllocationPass`, `FreePass`, `InitPass`, `MemsafePass`, `VerificationPass`: Legacy pass adapters (being phased out)

**Parallel execution:** When `-j N` is given (N > 1), the driver uses `LLMPool` and `orderer.get_parallel_levels()` to execute functions at the same depth in the SCC DAG concurrently. Synchronizes at level boundaries to ensure transitive dependencies are resolved.

**Incremental support:** When `dirty_ids` is provided, the driver computes the affected set (dirty functions + transitive callers via reverse edges) and only re-summarizes those; all others load from cache.

### 7. Code-Contract Pipeline (`code_contract/`)

The primary summarization pipeline. Produces Hoare-style contracts (requires/ensures/modifies) per function, per safety property, with interleaved verification. Designed for efficient use with small/local models (Haiku, Qwen) via cached system prompts and per-property single-turn calls.

**Properties:** `memsafe` (null deref, buffer overflow, use-after-free), `memleak` (resource leaks), `overflow` (integer overflow, division-by-zero, shift UB).

**Modules:**
- `models.py`: `CodeContractSummary` dataclass — per-property `requires` (preconditions), `ensures` (postconditions), `modifies` (written locations), `notes`, `origin` (provenance tracking for each requires clause), `noreturn` flag, optional `inline_body`
- `pass_.py`: `CodeContractPass` — implements `SummaryPass` protocol; per-property LLM calls with interleaved verification; callee discharge (every callee requires must be discharged or propagated)
- `prompts.py`: System prompt + per-property prompts (`MEMSAFE_PROMPT`, `MEMLEAK_PROMPT`, `OVERFLOW_PROMPT`, `VERIFY_PROMPT`) with detailed rules for contract generation
- `features.py`: Static-analysis feature gating — determines which properties are in scope per function using regex heuristics or KAMain IR sidecar data; clang warning bump; LLVM attribute drops (`readnone` → skip memsafe+memleak)
- `inliner.py`: Builds callee contract blocks and inlines callsite annotations; expands inline-body callees as comments
- `source_prep.py`: Prepares function source with typedef sections and macro annotations
- `checker.py`: Phase 7 entry-point obligation checking — walks call graph from entry functions, surfaces non-trivial `requires` clauses with witness chains tracing back through `origin` links to leaf operations
- `stdlib.py`: Hardcoded stdlib contracts (malloc, free, memcpy, etc.) that seed the pipeline

**Key design principles:**
- **Code is the summary** — contracts are C-expression predicates attached to source, not JSON taxonomies
- **No verdict field** — compositional pre/post only; bug-finding is the separate entry-point check
- **Callee discharge is mandatory** — every callee `requires` must be either discharged (satisfied locally) or propagated; no inventing new clauses
- **Adaptive scoping** — only ask property questions a function can answer (static features + callee signatures)
- **Inline small functions** — if body < threshold, paste at callsites instead of summarizing

**DB table:** `code_contract_summaries`
**CLI:** `llm-summary summarize`, `llm-summary check`

### 7-legacy. Summary Generators (legacy, no longer wired into CLI)

`summarizer.py`, `free_summarizer.py`, `init_summarizer.py`, `memsafe_summarizer.py`, `verification_summarizer.py`

Per-function LLM summarization logic across five separate passes. The classes still ship for batch-script and downstream consumers, but the CLI's `summarize` command no longer drives them.

**Key classes:**
- `AllocationSummarizer`: Allocation/buffer-size-pair analysis
- `FreeSummarizer`: Free/deallocation analysis
- `InitSummarizer`: Initialization post-condition analysis
- `MemsafeSummarizer`: Safety contract (pre-condition) analysis
- `VerificationSummarizer`: Cross-pass verification and contract simplification
- `IncrementalSummarizer`: Handles source-change invalidation, delegates re-summarization to `BottomUpDriver`
- `ExternalFunctionSummarizer` (`external_summarizer.py`): Generates summaries for functions without source code

### 8. Database (`db.py`)

SQLite storage for all analysis data.

**Tables:**
- `functions`: Function metadata, source, canonical signature, params JSON, callsites JSON
- `allocation_summaries`: Generated allocation summaries as JSON
- `free_summaries`: Generated free/deallocation summaries as JSON
- `init_summaries`: Generated initialization summaries as JSON
- `memsafe_summaries`: Generated safety contract summaries as JSON
- `verification_summaries`: Generated verification results as JSON
- `code_contract_summaries`: Hoare-style per-property contracts as JSON (primary pipeline)
- `call_edges`: Call graph with callsite locations
- `address_taken_functions`: Functions whose addresses are taken
- `address_flows`: Where function addresses flow to
- `address_flow_summaries`: LLM-generated address flow analysis
- `indirect_callsites`: Indirect call expressions
- `indirect_call_targets`: Resolved indirect call targets with confidence
- `build_configs`: Project build system information
- `container_summaries`: Container/collection function detection results
- `typedefs`: Type declarations (typedef, using, struct/class/union)
- `issue_reviews`: Manual triage records for verification issues (status, reason, reviewer)

### 9. Standard Library (`stdlib.py`, `code_contract/stdlib.py`)

Pre-defined summaries for common C standard library functions, seeded before bottom-up analysis so they are cache hits.

**Code-contract stdlib** (`code_contract/stdlib.py`): Hoare-style requires/ensures/modifies contracts for libc functions (malloc, free, memcpy, memset, strlen, printf, etc.). Used by the primary code-contract pipeline.

**Legacy stdlib** (`stdlib.py`): Per-pass summaries (allocation, free, init, memsafe) for the legacy multi-pass pipeline. Still importable, but no longer auto-loaded by `summarize`.

### 10. V-Snapshot Alias Context (`vsnapshot.py`, `alias_context.py`)

Integrates whole-program pointer aliasing data from external CFL analysis (kanalyzer). Currently consumed only by the legacy `MemsafePass`/`VerificationPass` via the `alias_builder` parameter. **TODO:** wire alias context into the code-contract pipeline — it's useful precision (groups aliasing pointers, annotates may-alias fields/params) that the contract prompts would benefit from.

- **`VSnapshot`** (`vsnapshot.py`): Loads V-snapshot binary format — per-function alias sets showing which pointers may alias at each program point
- **`AliasContextBuilder`** (`alias_context.py`): Builds alias context sections for LLM prompts from V-snapshot data. Groups aliasing pointers and annotates which fields/parameters may point to the same memory

### 11. Allocator & Container Detection (`allocator.py`, `container.py`)

Heuristic + LLM-based detection of project-specific patterns:

- **`AllocatorDetector`** (`allocator.py`): Identifies custom allocator/deallocator functions (e.g., `g_malloc`, `png_malloc`)
- **`ContainerDetector`** (`container.py`): Detects container/collection functions (e.g., list append, hash insert)

### 12. Harness Generator (`harness_generator.py`)

Generates C shim harnesses for contract-guided concolic execution via SymSan/ucsan. For a target function, the harness wraps it with a `test()` entry point and synthesizes `__dfsw_`-prefixed stubs for all callees so that SymSan's taint tracking can propagate through them.

**Key features:**
- LLM-generated shim: reads the function's memsafe contracts and post-conditions, asks the LLM to write a matching `test()` body and callee stubs
- Compilation loop: when `--ko-clang-path` is set, compiles the shim against project bitcode and iterates with LLM to fix errors (up to 3 attempts)
- Plan generation (`--plan` / `--plan-only`): instruments the target binary with basic-block IDs and asks the LLM to produce an exploration plan (sequence of BB targets) for the Thoroupy policy scheduler
- Issue assessment (`--assess-issue N`): injects a targeted assertion for verification issue N into an existing shim, rebuilds, and runs ucsan to confirm or refute the issue
- Outputs per-function `.c`, `.bc`, `.sh`, `.ucsan.cfg`, `.abilist`, and optionally `plan.json`

**Key class:** `HarnessGenerator`

See [ucsan-harness.md](ucsan-harness.md) for the full workflow.

### 13. Build-Learn System (`builder/`)

LLM-driven incremental build system that can configure, build, and learn from C/C++ projects.

**Key classes:**
- `Builder` (`builder.py`): ReAct-loop agent that iteratively configures and builds projects using LLM tool calls
- `AssemblyChecker` (`assembly_checker.py`): Detects standalone and inline assembly in build artifacts; supports iterative minimization
- `ErrorAnalyzer` (`error_analyzer.py`): Parses build failures for actionable diagnostics
- `ScriptGenerator` (`script_generator.py`): Auto-generates reproducible build scripts

Supports CMake, Autotools, Meson, Bazel, SCons, and custom build systems. Assembly detection scans `compile_commands.json`, source files, and LLVM IR. See [build-learn.md](build-learn.md) for details.

### 14. Link-Unit Pipeline (`link_units/`)

Batch analysis pipeline aware of build targets (executables, libraries). One DB per link unit; targets processed in dependency order.

- **`LinkUnitDiscoverer`** (`discoverer.py`): ReAct agent that explores build artifacts to identify all link units and their dependency relationships
- **`Pipeline`** (`pipeline.py`): Orchestrates per-target extract → summarize workflows
- **`batch_call_graph_gen.py`**: Runs two-phase compositional KAMain per target in topo order
- **`batch_summarize.py`**: Runs init-stdlib, import-dep-summaries, and summarization per target

See [link-unit-analysis.md](link-unit-analysis.md) for the full design.

### 15. CLI (`cli.py`)

Command-line interface using Click.

**Commands:**
- `build-learn`: Incremental project builder with LLM-driven ReAct loop
- `discover-link-units`: Detect build targets/link units
- `scan`: Per-target function extraction + indirect-call scan from `compile_commands.json`
- `import-callgraph`: Import KAMain JSON call graph into a target DB
- `init-stdlib`: Populate external/stdlib summaries (cache hits for the primary pass)
- `import-dep`, `import-dep-summaries`: Pull in cross- and intra-project dependency summaries
- `summarize`: Generate per-function code contracts (`-j N` for parallel)
- `check`: Entry-point obligation check — surfaces non-trivial `requires` at entry functions with witness chains (no LLM)
- `lookup`, `export`, `show`, `stats`: Inspect contracts and DB state
- `callgraph`: Export call graph as tuples / CSV / JSON
- `triage`, `gen-harness`, `reflect`, `consume-validation`, `bug-report`: Triage and validation pipeline (ucsan / SymSan)
- `show-issues`, `review-issue`: List and triage verification issues

## End-to-End Pipeline

The full pipeline for analyzing a project has nine phases (7 core + 2 optional). Each phase corresponds to one or more CLI commands. For link-unit projects, phases 2–7 run per target in dependency order (libraries before executables).

See [link-unit-analysis.md](link-unit-analysis.md) for the full link-unit design and cross-project dependency handling.

### Phase 0: Build (`build-learn`)

LLM-driven ReAct agent that configures and builds the project inside a Docker container with LLVM 18. Produces `compile_commands.json` and `.bc` bitcode files (via `-flto=full -save-temps=obj`). Generates a reusable build script in `build-scripts/<project>/`.

See [build-learn.md](build-learn.md) for details.

**Output:** `compile_commands.json`, `.bc` files, `build.sh`, `config.json`

### Phase 1: Discover Link Units (`discover-link-units`)

ReAct agent that explores build artifacts to identify all link units (libraries, executables) and their intra-project dependency relationships. Parses `build.ninja`, `link.txt`, archives (`ar t`), and ELF headers.

**Output:** `func-scans/<project>/link_units.json`

### Phase 2: Scan Functions (`scan`)

Per-target function extraction using libclang. Parses source files from `compile_commands.json`, extracts function definitions, builds the AST-based call graph, and identifies address-taken functions and indirect callsites.

When `--link-units` and `--target` are given, restricts extraction to source files belonging to the named target.

**Output:** `functions.db` per target (functions, call_edges, address_taken_functions, indirect_callsites)

### Phase 3: Call Graph (`batch_call_graph_gen.py` / KAMain)

LLVM IR-based CFL-reachability points-to analysis via KAMain. The batch script locates `.bc` files using a three-tier strategy:

1. Look for `.bc` next to `.o` (from `-save-temps=obj`)
2. Use `.o` as bitcode directly if `-flto` was used
3. Recompile sources with `-emit-llvm` to produce `.bc`

Two KAMain sub-phases per target:

1. **Compress** — produces a compressed CFL constraint graph (`.cflcg`) from the target's `.bc` files
2. **Compose + solve** — composes the target's constraint graph with those of its transitive deps to produce the call graph (`.json`) and V-snapshot (`.vsnap`)

Processes targets in topological order (deps before dependents). Writes `db_path`, `callgraph_json`, `cflcg`, `vsnapshot` back into `link_units.json`. Also extracts allocator candidates from `functions.db` for KAMain.

See [indirect-call-analysis.md](indirect-call-analysis.md) for details on indirect call resolution.

**Output:** `callgraph.json`, `<target>.cflcg`, `<target>.vsnap` per target

### Phase 4: Import Call Graph (`import-callgraph`)

Imports KAMain JSON call graph into `functions.db`. Matches KAMain function entries to existing DB functions by name, file+name, or suffix. Creates stubs for unmatched external functions (libc, deps). Run automatically by `batch_call_graph_gen.py` after KAMain completes.

**Output:** `call_edges` table populated in `functions.db`

### Phase 5: Seed Summaries (`init-stdlib`, `import-dep-summaries`)

Before summarization, populate the target DB with pre-existing summaries so the bottom-up driver treats them as cache hits:

1. **`init-stdlib`** — inserts pre-defined summaries for C standard library functions (malloc, free, memcpy, etc.)
2. **`import-dep-summaries`** — copies function stubs and all summary types from dependency DBs (e.g., zlib summaries imported when analyzing libpng), tagged with `model_used="dep:<project>/<target>"`

**Output:** stdlib and dependency function stubs + summaries in `functions.db`

### Phase 6: Summarize (`summarize`)

Bottom-up LLM summarization via `BottomUpDriver`. Builds the call graph once, computes SCCs via Tarjan's algorithm, and traverses in topological order (callees first).

**Code-contract pipeline (primary):** A single `CodeContractPass` produces Hoare-style contracts per function, per in-scope property:

| Property | What it captures |
|----------|------------------|
| `memsafe` | Null deref, buffer overflow, use-after-free, uninitialized use |
| `memleak` | Resource leaks (alloc without matching free) |
| `overflow` | Integer overflow, division-by-zero, shift UB |

For each function, the pass: (1) computes in-scope properties via static feature gating, (2) makes one LLM call per property to produce requires/ensures/modifies, (3) runs an interleaved verification call to check callee discharge, (4) stores the merged `CodeContractSummary`. Small functions (body shorter than the contract would be) are inlined as raw body at callsites instead of being summarized.

Functions with existing contracts (stdlib, deps, prior runs) are cache hits. Only new/dirty functions get LLM calls. Parallel execution across SCC levels with `-j N`.

**Output:** `code_contract_summaries` in `functions.db`

<details>
<summary>Legacy multi-pass pipeline (no longer in CLI; classes still present)</summary>

| Pass | Type | Direction | What it captures |
|------|------|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | `allocation` | Post-condition | Allocations, buffer-size pairs, may-be-null |
| 2 | `free` | Post-condition | Deallocations, conditional frees, nulled-after |
| 3 | `init` | Post-condition | Guaranteed initializations (caller-visible) |
| 4 | `memsafe` | Pre-condition | Safety contracts (not-null, buffer-size, etc.) |
| 5 | `verify` | Cross-pass | Issues + simplified contracts |

The `summarize` CLI no longer drives these passes; the pass classes (`AllocationPass`, `FreePass`, `InitPass`, `MemsafePass`, `VerificationPass`) remain importable for batch-script use. Tables (`allocation_summaries`, etc.) are still in the schema.
</details>

### Phase 7: Entry-Point Check (`check`)

After code-contract summarization, the checker walks the call graph from entry functions (functions with no callers) and surfaces every non-trivial `requires` clause as an `Obligation`. Each obligation includes a witness chain built by following `origin` links back through the callees that propagated the clause, terminating at `local` leaves where the requirement originates from a concrete operation.

No LLM is needed — this is a pure-Python graph traversal over stored contracts.

**Output:** `check_report.json` with obligations per entry function

### Phase 8 (optional): Issue Triage (`show-issues`, `review-issue`)

After verification (legacy pipeline), analysts review flagged issues. `show-issues` lists all `SafetyIssue` records from `verification_summaries` with their current review status. `review-issue` updates the `issue_reviews` table for a specific issue:

- **confirmed** — real bug, ready for downstream use
- **false_positive** — LLM hallucination or infeasible path
- **wontfix** — acknowledged but intentionally not fixed

**Output:** `issue_reviews` records in `functions.db`

### Phase 9 (optional): Harness Generation (`gen-harness`)

For issues of interest, generate a C shim harness to drive contract-guided concolic execution with SymSan/ucsan. The harness wraps the target function's contracts and can be used with the Thoroupy policy scheduler for path exploration.

See [ucsan-harness.md](ucsan-harness.md) for details.

**Output:** `harnesses/<project>/<func>.*` — shim, bitcode, build script, ucsan config

### Batch Processing

Batch scripts under `scripts/` orchestrate the pipeline across multiple projects and link-unit targets. Projects are read from `gpr_projects.json` and filtered by tier, name, or skip list.

| Script | Phase | What it does |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `batch_build_learn.py` | 0 | Runs `build-learn` for each project sequentially |
| `batch_scan_targets.py` | 2 | Extracts functions, address-taken, indirect callsites (`-j` parallel) |
| `batch_call_graph_gen.py` | 3–4 | Runs KAMain (compositional CFL) + imports call graph per target |
| `batch_code_contract.py` | 5–7 | Seeds stdlib/dep contracts, runs code-contract summarization, optional entry-point check |
| `batch_summarize.py` | 5–6 | (Legacy) Seeds stdlib/dep summaries, runs passes 1–3 then pass 4 separately |
| `batch_verify.py` | 6 | (Legacy) Runs pass 5 (verification) after passes 1–4 complete |
| `batch_container_detect.py` | aux | Detects container functions (heuristic + LLM) |
| `cgc_run.sh` | benchmark | Full CGC benchmark: extract GT, scan, verify, evaluate |

All link-unit-aware scripts read `link_units.json` and toposort targets by `link_deps`. `batch_code_contract.py` runs `import-dep` and `import-dep-summaries` before each target's summarization. Cross-project dependencies are tracked in `project_deps.json`.

See [cgc-benchmark.md](cgc-benchmark.md) for the CGC benchmark pipeline.

**Supporting scripts:**
- `gpr_utils.py` — shared utilities (Docker path translation, project discovery)
- `clone_gpr_projects.py` — clone projects from `gpr_projects.json` URLs
- `update_gpr_projects.py` — git pull and update project metadata
- `guess_language.py` — LLM-based language detection, auto-demotes non-C/C++ to tier 3
- `fix_compile_commands.py` — fix Docker/container paths in `compile_commands.json`
- `batch_rebuild.py` — re-run build scripts (e.g., with debug flags)

### Example: libpng depends on zlib

```
Step 1: Analyze zlib (no deps)
  build-learn                     → compile_commands.json, .bc files
  discover-link-units             → zlib/link_units.json
  scan --target zlibstatic        → zlib/zlibstatic/functions.db
  KAMain phase 1                  → zlib/zlibstatic/zlibstatic.cflcg
  KAMain phase 2                  → zlib/zlibstatic/callgraph.json, .vsnap
  import-callgraph                → call_edges in functions.db
  init-stdlib                     → stdlib contracts
  summarize                       → per-function Hoare-style contracts
  check                           → entry-point obligations

Step 2: Analyze libpng (depends on zlib)
  build-learn                     → compile_commands.json, .bc files
  discover-link-units             → libpng/link_units.json
  scan --target libpng16          → libpng/libpng16/functions.db
  KAMain phase 1                  → libpng/libpng16/libpng16.cflcg
  KAMain phase 2 (+zlib)          → libpng/libpng16/callgraph.json, .vsnap
  import-callgraph                → call_edges
  import-dep + import-dep-summaries → zlib contracts copied in
  init-stdlib                     → stdlib contracts
  summarize                       → per-function contracts (zlib → cache hit)
  check                           → entry-point obligations
```

### Incremental Updates

When source files change:

1. Compute new source hash
2. Compare with stored hash
3. If changed:
   - Invalidate function's summary
   - Cascade invalidation to all callers (transitive)
4. Re-analyze only invalidated functions (dirty set + reverse-edge closure)

## Safety Analysis Framework

### Code-Contract Pipeline (primary)

The system uses a Hoare-logic approach: each function gets a contract of **requires** (preconditions callers must satisfy) and **ensures** (postconditions the function guarantees), scoped per safety property. Analysis is bottom-up — callee contracts are available when analyzing callers.

**Per-property contracts:**

| Property | Requires (preconditions) | Ensures (postconditions) |
|----------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| `memsafe` | not-null, valid-buffer-size, initialized, not-freed | null-check guarantees, initialization, deallocation |
| `memleak` | (rare) | allocations returned/stored, frees performed |
| `overflow` | value-range bounds, non-zero divisor | output-range bounds |

**Contract composition rules:**
- **Callee discharge is mandatory**: at each callsite, the caller must either satisfy the callee's `requires` locally or propagate it as its own `requires`
- **No verdict field**: the contract is pre/post only — bug-finding happens in the separate entry-point check (Phase 7), which surfaces any `requires` clause that reaches an entry function undischarged
- **Origin tracking**: each `requires` clause records whether it was derived locally or propagated from a callee (with index), enabling witness chains from entry functions back to the leaf operation

**Adaptive property scoping:** Not every function needs every property. Static feature gating (regex over source, or KAMain IR sidecar data) determines which of {memsafe, memleak, overflow} are in scope. LLVM function attributes can drop properties entirely (`readnone` → skip memsafe+memleak). Clang `-Wall` warnings bump feature bits back when constant-folding deletes the IR evidence.

**Inline-body shortcut:** Functions whose body is shorter than the contract would be are not summarized — their raw body is pasted at every callsite instead, giving callers full visibility.

### Legacy Multi-Pass Pipeline (being phased out)

<details>
<summary>Five separate passes with different JSON schemas</summary>

The legacy pipeline uses five passes. Post-condition passes (1-3) summarize what each function *produces*. The pre-condition pass (4) summarizes what each function *requires*. The verification pass (5) checks that post-conditions satisfy pre-conditions at each call site.

| Pass | Type | Direction | What it captures |
|------|------|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | `allocation` | Post-condition | Allocations, buffer-size pairs, may-be-null |
| 2 | `free` | Post-condition | Deallocations, conditional frees, nulled-after |
| 3 | `init` | Post-condition | Guaranteed initializations (caller-visible) |
| 4 | `memsafe` | Pre-condition | Safety contracts (not-null, buffer-size, etc.) |
| 5 | `verify` | Cross-pass | Issues + simplified contracts |

| Safety class | Post-condition passes | Pre-condition (pass 4) |
|---|---|---|
| Buffer overflow | 1 (allocation size) | buffer-size contracts |
| Null dereference | 1 (may_be_null) | not-null contracts |
| Use-after-free | 2 (what's freed) | not-freed contracts |
| Double free | 2 (what's freed) | not-freed contracts |
| Uninitialized use | 3 (what's initialized) | must-be-initialized contracts |

The CLI no longer exposes per-pass `--type`; consumers that still want these summaries instantiate the pass classes directly from Python.

### Why libclang?

- Accurate parsing of C/C++ including macros and templates
- Provides full AST access for call extraction
- Handles complex preprocessor directives
- Industry-standard tool

### Why SQLite?

- Single-file database, easy to manage
- Supports complex queries for lookups
- ACID transactions for data integrity
- No external server required

### Why bottom-up analysis?

- Callee summaries provide context for caller analysis
- Enables compositional reasoning
- Reduces redundant LLM calls
- Matches how humans understand code

### Why JSON for summaries?

- Flexible schema evolution
- Easy to parse and generate
- Human-readable for debugging
- LLMs handle JSON well
