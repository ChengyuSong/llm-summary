"""Per-function source-prep for the code-contract pipeline.

Two-step source-prep API:
  - `build_type_defs_section(db, source, file_path)` — typedef / struct /
    static-var definitions referenced by the source. Property-independent
    (cacheable across the per-property calls for one function).
  - `prepare_source(func, summaries, edges, prop)` — macro-annotated
    function source with callee contracts inlined for `prop`. Per-property
    (the `{source}` placeholder in PROPERTY_PROMPT).

`build_type_defs_section` is a free function lifted from the legacy
`VerificationSummarizer._build_type_defs_section` — single implementation,
both pipelines import from here.
