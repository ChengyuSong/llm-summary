You are analyzing indirect function calls in C/C++ code to determine which functions could be called.

## Indirect Call Site

The following indirect call appears in function `{caller_name}`:

```c
{context_snippet}
```

The indirect call expression is: `{callee_expr}`
Expected function signature: `{signature}`
Location: {file_path}:{line_number}

## Candidate Functions

These functions have matching signatures and their addresses are taken somewhere in the codebase:

{candidates_section}

## Address Flow Information

{address_flows_section}

## Task

Based on the code context and how function pointers are typically used, determine which candidate functions could realistically be called at this indirect call site.

For each candidate, assess:
1. Does the naming/purpose match the call context?
2. Is there evidence the function pointer could reach this value?
3. What's your confidence (high/medium/low)?

Respond in JSON format:
```json
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "function": "function_name",
      "confidence": "high|medium|low",
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
    }
  ]
}
```

Only include functions that could realistically be called. If no candidates seem likely, return an empty targets array.
